# Problem Statement

React project

1. Create a react native application, you need to use the react latest version
2. On the first screen Main , we will show the content of an array of objects in a table/grid , one
object per row
3. The array of objects should be of this form
{
Id - number
First Name – string
Last Name – string
Date of birth – date
Married – checkbox
Photo – url
}
4. This Main screen should also have an Add button
5. Each row should have a delete icon or button. When the user press on it, the object will be
deleted from array and it will disappear from the grid
6. When the user press Add button, he will be redirected to another screen where the user can fill
in First Name, Last Name, Date of birth, Married and he can add a photo from a local folder .
This screen will have a Save button. When press on it, it will save the data from this screen in
the main array, and the user will be redirected back to the Main screen. The record new
inserted in array should be shown in the main screen in the grid.
7. Each row shin the grid should have an edit button or icon. When the user press this button , it
will show an edit screen with the same controls as the Add new , where the user can edit the
data for that record. All the fields should be editable , including the picture (the user can change
it). This screen will have as well Save button. When the user press it, the object will be updated
in array and refreshed in the grid.
8. Id field should be an autoincrement . All the fields are mandatory
9. You can use only one screen for both Add New / Edit
10. The design should be nice and the functionality should be logic. If you need to add any other
field or button or library, you can add it

# Solution
Since I have experience on ReactJs I have created the following applicatio using Reactjs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
